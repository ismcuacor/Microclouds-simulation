This folder contains the code necessary to run a simulation in NS3 of the RENATER's french research core network (as it was in 2016). This network is a good example of a national-wide core network, and its topology is publicly
accessible [1]. 

To increase the size of the network, we have two versions of the data. First, we added two extra devices connected to each interface of the original PoPs. These new devices represent extra PoPs serving data to the region. 
Those nodes have been designed to use either wired or wireless technologies, to simulate a realistic scenario.
